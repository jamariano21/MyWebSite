				<p>Welcome to my portfolio. 
				   Here you will find some pictures of my life and projects 
					since I have no idea what else to put in here. 
					Happy seeing.

					<p> I was able to take this portrait picture last year during my photography class. 
					    This, among a few other edited photos, was for a project called Portrait Photography,
					    in which I needed to capture photos of subjects and use editing elements to enhance the
					    the picture in some way. In this image, I added a filter to give it a grayscale, as well as
					    a retro-type style portrayed as the orange-reddish flare.

			<div class="polaroid">
				<img src="cspicon.png" width=400px height=350px />
				<div class="container">
					<p> I was able to create this icon using code.org's encoding color images widget. 
					    In this widget, I adjusted the image width to 19 pixels and the image height to 19 pixels
					    to get a 19 x 18 image; I also adjusted the bits per image to 12 to get a pixel data made up of 3 hexadecimals.
					    I then used a website with triple hex color codes to help color my image of a stethoscope, 
					    which signifies the medical field, my future career. In this activity I was able to learn how to create
					    and encode color images by creating image dimensions and using a unique set of color pixel data.
					    The significance of the icon is that it represents something that relates to me, since
					    it is a significant symbol of doctors, but in general, the medical field, a career that
					    is improtant to my family and my future.

				<img src="CuteAngel.jpg" width=400px height=315px />
				<div class="container">
					<p> This is another photography class photo where I took a picture of my friend,
					    Angel Millan. The photo, which is also a part of the Portrait Photography photo,
					    includes a subject with a background that seems out of color in a way and blurred 
					    if looked upon closely and carefully. I really liked this image and I believe that
					    this photo helped me earn a good grade overall for the project itself, as well as 
					    helped me get used to the different ways to edit using a software called Pixlr.
