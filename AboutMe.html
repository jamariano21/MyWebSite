			<h2>~Who Am I?~</h2>
			</div>
			<hr>
				<p> My name is Jeremiah Mariano and I am currently a junior at Damien High School. 
				    Just became 16-year-old about 2 months ago.  I live somewhere in Southern California 
				    and is sadly, a middle child of 3 other siblings. I am currently interested in applying 
				    to college somewhere in California, maybe San Diego, merely because I don't want to leave 
				    this state since I believe it will make life easier.
				</p>
				<br><br> 
				<p> I am currently active in playing basketball and enjoy playing soccer; exercise is an important
				    lifestyle, and that includes swimming. Catch me speaking English and French, especially since 
				    I have traveled to the UK and France. Whenever I have time, which is rare, I play video games 
				    with friends, such as Counter-Strike, or hang out with them in various places.
				</p>
